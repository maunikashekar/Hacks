# SORTING-STRINGS
## In this program, the user can input the number of strings for which the sorting to take place. The strings inputted will be sorted based on the first letter of the each string in alphabetical order.

Using this program you can learn the workings of a compareTo() which compares two strings lexigraphically which means that the characters in the two strings that are compared are converted to unicode value. The method returns zero(0) if the two strings are the same or returns any negative or positive value if the two strings are not same. 

<p>Let us see the sample output based on an example input:<p>
 <p>If the given input is:<p>
   
   + Zara
   
   + ashley
   
   + sonia
   
   + veronica
   
   + hazel
 <p>The output generated will be:<p>
  
   + asley
  
   + hazel
   
   + sonia 
   
   + veronica
   
   + zara
